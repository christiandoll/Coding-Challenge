Initial Code Presentation

Hello All!

My name is Christian Doll, and I am a Tech Professional, based in Austin, Texas. I have 18 years of experience in this field, and have performed many roles over these years, but I am currently a Database Administrator, specializing in SQL Server and Hadoop.

I will be presenting my code through this GitHub.
